# Library Management System
PROBLEMA: The user can do many things in the Library Management system. 
The user can borrow a book, return a book and display available books. The Librarian should be able 
to upload a list of books and modify such list if a book is lost or damaged. You should be able to 
browse all the available collections or find a book by searching (you only need to think in exact 
string matching, not approximate)
